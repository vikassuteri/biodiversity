<p>what is biodiversity?</p>
Biodiversity is the variety of all forms of life and it is
essential to the existence and proper functioning of all
ecosystem.<br>
Biodiversity supports habitats for all species by providing
many unique environments in which species can exist; these
include ecosystems of all types and sizes, rare ecosystems, and
corridors between habitats.
<pre>Many scientists believe biodiversity, as it represents
all forms of life on earth, provides or supports the core benefits
that humans derive from their environment.</pre>
<p style="font-style:strong;font-size:larger;color:red;" > 
<b>Biodiversity is fundamental for the provision of
ecosystem services, which we depend on for food, air, and water
security, and multiple other natural benefits.</b></p>
